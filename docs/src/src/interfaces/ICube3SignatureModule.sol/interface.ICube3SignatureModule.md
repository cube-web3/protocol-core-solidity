# ICube3SignatureModule

[Git Source](https://github.com/cube-web3/protocol-core-solidity/blob/07ba602bddefe3eb8d740b07000837f7ec2fa9f5/src/interfaces/ICube3SignatureModule.sol)

**Author:**
CUBE3.ai

Cube3 Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) module for signature verification and
data validation. The module is responsible for verifying that the payload received by the module was
generated by the Cube3 Risk API, and that the data it contains can be validated by recovering
the signing authority from the signature and the on-chain data.

_Inherits core module functionality from the Cube3Module contract._

_There's no access control implemented as no functionality requires elevated privileges._

_Module emits no events as a gas-saving measure._

## Functions

### validateSignature

```solidity
function validateSignature(
    Structs.IntegrationCallMetadata memory integrationData,
    bytes calldata cube3SecurePayload
)
    external
    returns (bytes32);
```

## Events

### RegistryUpdated

```solidity
event RegistryUpdated(address indexed newRegistry, address indexed deprecatedRegistry);
```

## Structs

### SignatureModulePayloadData

Defines the structure of the cube3SecurePayload and its contents for the Cube3 Signature Module.

_The `cube3SecurePayload` is passed in as function parameter to all Cube3Integration integration functions._

```solidity
struct SignatureModulePayloadData {
    uint256 expirationTimestamp;
    bool shouldTrackNonce;
    uint256 nonce;
    bytes signature;
}
```
